## About Me

Hello, my name is Majid Ahmad Kundroo, and I am a driven and enthusiastic Ph.D. student at [NCLAB](https://nclab.cbnu.ac.kr). I am deeply involved in the field of artificial intelligence. My undivided attention is drawn to the interesting field of federated learning. With an insatiable curiosity and an uncompromising passion for innovation, I am dedicated to developing vital solutions for more efficient, secure, and decentralized approaches to machine learning. I'm on a quest to shape the future of AI, armed with an extensive understanding of complex algorithms and a solid foundation in statistical analysis. My research focuses on the enormous potential of federated learning, a decentralized technique that allows collaborative model training across numerous devices or companies while maintaining data privacy. I hope to create rapid, secure, and privacy-preserving solutions that enable enterprises to leverage the collective intelligence of their dispersed data by developing distinctive approaches and algorithms.
