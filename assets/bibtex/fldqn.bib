ABSTRACT = {The increasing volume of traffic has led to severe challenges, including traffic congestion, heightened energy consumption, increased air pollution, and prolonged travel times. Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches for optimizing road network utilization. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in dynamic scenarios like traffic management, their primary focus has been on single-agent setups, limiting their applicability to real-world multi-agent systems. Managing agents and fostering collaboration in a multi-agent reinforcement learning scenario remains a challenging task. This paper introduces a cooperative multi-agent federated reinforcement learning algorithm named FLDQN to address the challenge of agent cooperation by solving travel time minimization challenges in dynamic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. FLDQN leverages federated learning to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among intelligent agents, optimizing vehicle routing and reducing congestion in dynamic traffic environments. Using the SUMO simulator, multiple agents equipped with deep Q-learning models interact with their local environments, share model updates via a federated server, and collectively enhance their policies using unique local observations while benefiting from the collective experiences of other agents. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FLDQN achieves a significant average reduction of over 34.6% in travel time compared to non-cooperative methods while simultaneously lowering the computational overhead through distributed learning. FLDQN underscores the vital impact of agent cooperation and provides an innovative solution for enabling agent cooperation in a multi-agent environment.},
