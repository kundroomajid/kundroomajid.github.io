ABSTRACT = {Soil moisture estimation is crucial for agricultural productivity and environmental management. This study explores the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to optimize soil moisture estimation. By combining data from WSN nodes with satellite and climate data, this research aims to enhance the accuracy and resolution of soil moisture estimation, enabling more effective agricultural planning, irrigation management, and environmental monitoring. Five ML models, including linear regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), are evaluated and compared using real-world data from multiple geographical regions, which includes a dataset from NASAâ€™s SMAP project, supplemented by climate data, which employs both active and passive sensors for data collection. The outcomes demonstrate that the LSTM model consistently outperforms other ML algorithms across various evaluation metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of WSN-driven approaches to soil moisture estimation. The study contributes to the advancement of soil moisture monitoring technologies, offering insights into the potential of WSNs combined with ML and DL for sustainable agriculture and environmental management practices.},
